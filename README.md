This is just a compilation of all some frequent includes I do on my ruby code

Hash
----

### deep_merge

When merging Hashes it will take care of merging nested hashes 

### deep_has_key?

Provide multiple keys and it will tell you if they are contained in the current hash, taking nesting into account
